        <details>
            <summary>When did tacos first appear in the United States?</summary>
            <p>Tacos first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century, around the 1910s. 
                They were introduced by Mexican immigrants, particularly in the Southwestern states like Texas and California.
                The first known mention of the word "taco" in the U.S. press was in 1905, in a newspaper article about Mexican food in Los Angeles. 
                Tacos gained wider popularity as Mexican street food culture spread, especially during the Mexican Revolution (1910â€“1920), when many people immigrated to the U.S.Over time, tacos were adapted to American tastes, leading to the creation of hard-shell tacos in the 1940s and the rise of fast-food taco chains like Taco Bell, 
                founded in 1962.</p>
